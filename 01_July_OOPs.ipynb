    "An object is called an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"Car\" class. This class might have attributes like \"color,\" \"brand,\" and \"model,\" as well as methods like \"start_engine\" and \"drive.\" When you create an object of the \"Car\" class, say a red Toyota Camry, you are creating a specific car that has its own color, brand, and model, and you can make it start the engine and drive.\n",

    "### 3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as a blueprint for building objects, just like a recipe for making a specific type of cake. The class defines the structure, attributes, and behaviors that the objects of that class will have. It acts as a template that allows you to create multiple instances of the same type, each with its own unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"Car\" class. This class would describe the common features and actions that all cars have, such as attributes like \"color,\" \"brand,\" and \"model,\" and methods like \"start_engine\" and \"drive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a class, you are essentially defining the blueprint for what a car should be like. It's like saying, \"Every car created from this blueprint will have a color, a brand, and a model, and they can all start their engine and drive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the \"Car\" class defined, you can create individual car objects based on that blueprint. For instance, you might create a red Toyota Camry by using the \"Car\" class as a guide. This car object will have its own unique color, brand, and model, but it will share the same structure and behaviors defined in the \"Car\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes allow you to organize your code and promote code reusability. You can create many car objects using the same \"Car\" class without having to rewrite the attributes and methods for each car individually. This makes your code more efficient, easier to maintain, and helps you model real-world concepts in a more organized and systematic way.\n"
