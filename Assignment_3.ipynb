    "1.Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions provide several advantages when used in programs:\n",
    "Functions improve code quality, maintainability, and reusability, making your programs more efficient, readable,\n",
    "and easier to work with    \n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability: \n",
    "Functions allow you to break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces of code. Each function can perform a \n",
    "specific task, making the overall program more organized and easier to understand. Once defined, functions can be reused\n",
    "in multiple parts of your program or even in different programs, reducing code duplication and saving development\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions hide the implementation details of a certain task. This allows you to use the function without \n",
    "needing to understand how it works internally. This abstraction level simplifies the process of designing and using complex \n",
    "systems by providing a high-level interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and Maintainability: Functions improve the readability of your code by giving meaningful names to blocks of code.\n",
    "This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each part of your program. Additionally, when a bug is found or a change is \n",
    "required, you only need to modify the relevant function rather than searching through the entire program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing and Debugging:Functions allow you to isolate and test specific parts of your code more easily. You can write test \n",
    "cases for individual functions to ensure they work as expected. When a bug is encountered, you can focus your debugging efforts\n",
    "on the specific function, making it faster to locate and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration: Functions make it easier for multiple programmers to work on the same project simultaneously.\n",
    "different team members can work on separate functions without stepping on each other's toes. \n",
    "As long as the functions have well-defined inputs and outputs, integrating them into the larger project becomes straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Organization: Functions help organize your code into logical sections. You can have a main program that calls different\n",
    "functions for different tasks, providing a clear structure to your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:** Functions can encapsulate complex logic or processes. This means that you can have intricate processes \n",
    "hidden within a function, reducing the complexity of your main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameterization:** Functions can accept parameters, allowing you to pass data to them dynamically. This parameterization \n",
    "enables you to customize the behavior of a function based on different input values.\n",
