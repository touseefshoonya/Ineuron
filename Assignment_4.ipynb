    "Similarities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Sequence Type: Both lists and strings are sequence types, meaning they maintain order and allow indexing to access individual elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "4.Concatenation: You can concatenate (combine) multiple lists or strings using the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Mutability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: Lists are mutable, which means you can modify their elements after creation. We can change, add,\n",

    "\n",

    "Lists: Lists have methods like append(), insert(), remove(), and more, tailored to their mutable nature.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Mutability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: Lists are mutable, which means you can modify their elements after creation. You can add, remove,\n",

    "\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are immutable, which means their elements cannot be changed after creation. Once a tuple is created,\n",
    "its elements remain fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Lists: Lists are defined using square brackets [ ] and elements are separated by commas. For example: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "        \n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are defined using parentheses ( and ) and elements are separated by commas. For example: (1, 2, 3)  \n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Performance:\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use Cases:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Lists: Lists are used when you need a collection of elements that might change over time. You can add, remove,\n",
    "or modify elements as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are used when you want to create a collection of items that shouldn't be changed, such as representing\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Iteration:\n",
    "Both tuples and lists can be iterated over using loops, but the immutability of tuples makes them suitable for scenarios\n",
    "where you want to ensure the elements remain unchanged during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Methods:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Lists have more methods compared to tuples, such as append(), insert(), remove(), and more. This is because lists are\n",

    "\n",
    "Both copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() are functions from the copy module in Python, and they are used to create copies\n",
    "of objects, particularly complex objects like lists, dictionaries, and nested data structures.\n",
    "However, they differ in how they handle copying nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "copy.copy():\n",
    "\n",
    "This function creates a shallow copy of the object. A shallow copy creates a new object, but it does not create new copies\n",
    "of the objects contained within the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the object contains references to other objects (like lists or dictionaries), the copied object will share references\n",
    "to the same nested objects as the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to nested objects in the copied object will affect the original and vice versa.\n",
    "This function is suitable when you want a new object but don't need complete independence from the original's nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "original_list = [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)\n",

    "copy.deepcopy():\n",
    "    \n",
    "This function creates a deep copy of the object. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively creates\n",
    "new copies of all the nested objects within the original.\n",
    "Nested objects in the copied object are completely independent of the original. Changes to nested objects in\n",
    "the copied object won't affect the original, and vice versa.\n",
    "This function is suitable when you want a new object that is entirely independent of the original's nested objects.  \n",
