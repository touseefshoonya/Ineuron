    "\n",
    "Ans:  String:It simply represents text data and can include number ,letters,whitespaces or special charecter but should be in single or \n",
    "      double quote.Basically anything in single or double quote is a string('',\"\").\n",
    "      eg:\"Adidas\"\n",
    "        \"123Toy\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "     Variable:Variable is a name that represents a value stored in the computer's memory.\n",
    "     It's a way to give a label or identifier to a value so that you can refer to and manipulate it later in your code.   \n",
    "     eg: age=25\n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "#mentioning all data types for my future ref.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Integer (int):Integers are whole numbers without any decimal point. They can be positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating-Point (float):Floating-point numbers represent real numbers with a decimal point. They can represent both whole numbers\n",
    "and fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "String (str):\n",
    "    \n",
    "Strings represent sequences of characters. They are used to represent text-based data. Strings are enclosed in single ('') \n",
    "or double (\"\") quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean (bool):\n",
    "    \n",
    "Booleans represent two truth values: True and False.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "List:\n",
    "Lists are ordered collections of values, which can be of different data types. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified after creation. Lists are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. Examples: [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'].\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "Tuples are often used for grouping related data. They are enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.\n",
    "Examples: (1, 2, 3), ('January', 31).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Dictionaries store key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key. \n",
    "Keys are typically strings, and values can be of different data types. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces\n",
    "and consist of key-value pairs separated by colons. Examples: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are used to perform set operations like union, intersection, \n",
    "and difference. Sets are enclosed in curly braces or can be created using the set() constructor. Examples: {1, 2, 3}, set([3, 4, 5]).\n",
    "\n",
    "NoneType (None):\n",
    "None is a special data type representing the absence of a value. It's often used to indicate a lack of data \n",
    "or a default value. It is not the same as an empty string or zero. Example: None.\n",

    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression in programming is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated\n",
    "to produce a result. Expressions are the building blocks of programs and are used to perform operations and calculations.\n",
    "They can represent computations, comparisons, assignments, and more.\n",
    "An expression is typically made up of Values(\"hello\"),Variables(),Operators and Function Calls like(len(\"Hello\") or math.sqrt(25))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "spam = 10 is an assignment statement. It assigns the value 10 to the variable spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression:\n",
    "    \n",
    "An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce\n",
    "a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5 + 3   # This is an expression that evaluates to 8\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"   # This is an expression that evaluates to the string \"Alice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement:\n",
    "    \n",
    "A statement is a complete line of code that performs an action\n",
    "Unlike expressions, statements don't necessarily result in a value. Instead, they are executed for their side effects,\n",
    "such as modifying variables, controlling program flow, or interacting with external resources. Statements include assignments,\n",
    "control structures (like loops and conditionals), function and method calls, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5   # This is an assignment statement\n",
    "if x > 0:   # This is a conditional statement\n",
    "    print(\"Positive\")   # This is a print statement\n",

    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bacon will hold value as 22.If we want to increase it by +1 then folowing code should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon = bacon + 1 \n",
    "\n",

    "&#39;spam&#39; + &#39;spamspam&#39;\n",
    "&#39;spam&#39; * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "&#39; is an HTML entity code that represents the single quotation mark character (').However it is not required in python.\n",
    "We can directly use '' or \"\" quote.\n",

    "+ is used for conacatenation\n",

    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is because of naming convention used in python.100 is not a following valid naming convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable naming convention:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "2.The remaining characters in the variable name can be letters, underscores, or digits (0-9).\n",
    "3.Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVariable and myvariable would be treated as two different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string\n",
    "version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "int(): This function is used to convert a value to an integer. It takes a numeric string or a floating-point number\n",
    "as an argument and returns an integer version of that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# int_value = int(\"42\")\n",
    "\n",
    "float(): This function is used to convert a value to a floating-point number. \n",
    "It takes a numeric string or an integer as an argument and returns a floating-point version of that\n",
    "\n",
    "# float_value = float(\"3.14\")\n",
    "\n",
    "str(): This function is used to convert a value to a string. It takes any data type as an argument\n",
    "and returns a string representation of that value.Eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "# str_value = str(42)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "&#39;I have eaten &#39; + 99 + &#39; burritos.&#39;\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' causes an error because you are trying to concatenate a string\n",
    "('I have eaten ') with an integer (99) directly using the + operator. In Python, you can concatenate strings together\n",
    "using the + operator, but you cannot directly concatenate a string with an integer. You need to ensure that both operands\n",
    "of the + operator are of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, you can convert the integer 99 to a string using the str() function, and then perform the string concatenation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "result = 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "    \n",
