    "Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows us to create a new class \n",
    "(also known as a subclass or derived class) by inheriting the properties (attributes and methods) \n",
    "of an existing class (also known as a superclass or base class). This means that the subclass automatically \n",
    "has access to all the attributes and methods defined in the superclass, and it can also add its own unique\n",
    "attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A.Code Reusability:\n",
    "      Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing you to define common attributes and methods in a base class and using it in\n",
    "      subclass or derived class. \n",
    "\n",
    "    B.Modularity: \n",
    "      Inheritance helps in creating modular and well-structured code. You can separate different aspects of functionality \n",
    "      into separate classes,making it easier to understand, maintain, and update your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    C.Hierarchy:\n",
    "      Inheritance allows you to model real-world relationships and hierarchies. For instance, you can have a base class \n",
    "      \"Vehicle\" and derive subclasses like \"Car,\" \"Bicycle,\" and \"Truck,\" each inheriting common vehicle properties but \n",
    "       also having their specific properties and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    D.Polymorphism:\n",
    "      Inheritance is closely related to the polymorphism,Polymorphism means one function different use cases or implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "    E.Code Extensibility:\n",
    "      You can easily add new features by creating new subclasses without modifying\n",
    "      the existing code. This allows you to extend the functionality of your application without affecting its core structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement inheritance, you typically use a programming language's inheritance mechanism.\n",
    "In most OOP languages, a subclass is declared by specifying the superclass it inherits from.\n",
    "The subclass then inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass. Additionally, \n",
    "the subclass can define its own attributes and methods or override the inherited ones as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass  # Placeholder for method\n",
    "    \n",
    "class Dog(Animal):  # Dog is a subclass of Animal\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "class Cat(Animal):  # Cat is a subclass of Animal\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "In this example, the Animal class is the base class, and both Dog and Cat are subclasses. They inherit the name attribute from the base class and provide their own implementations of the speak method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, inheritance is a crucial concept in OOP that enables code reuse, modularity, hierarchy modeling, polymorphism, and code extensibility. It allows you to create more organized, maintainable, and scalable software systems.\n",
